# 🖥️ Active Directory Labs

This repository contains a series of **Active Directory (AD) labs** I’ve completed to gain hands-on experience with **Windows Server 2016** and **Windows 10 clients** in a virtualized environment.  

Each lab is structured in its own folder with a detailed README and screenshots for step-by-step guidance.
