## **Description**
This lab demonstrates **Active Directory user management operations** including:  
1. Creating an organizational unit (OU) and adding a new user.  
2. Resetting a user‚Äôs password in response to a support request.  
3. Disabling and deleting a user account based on workplace account lifecycle policies.  

These are core skills for system administrators managing users in an Active Directory environment.

## **Tools and Technologies Used**
- **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter (Domain Controller)**  
- **Windows 10 Pro (Client VM)**  
- **Oracle VirtualBox** (Virtualization)  
- **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**  

---

## **Environment**
- **Domain Name**: `WinAc.com`  
- **Organizational Units Created**:  
  - `Domain Users`  
  - `Domain Computers`  
  - `Disabled Users`  
- **Test User**: `Max Law` (`max.law@WinAc.com`)  

---

## **Task Instructions**
1. Create a new **Organizational Unit (OU)** for domain users and computers.  
2. Add a new user (`Max Law`) and verify login on a client machine.  
3. Simulate a **password reset request** from the user.  
4. Implement **disable and delete** workflows for user account lifecycle management.

## **My Configuration Steps**

### **Part 1 - Creating a User in Active Directory**

- Created a new OU structure inside `WinAc` for better organization:  
  - `Domain Users`  
  - `Domain Computers`

### **Part 2 - Resetting a User‚Äôs Password**

Scenario: A user complains they cannot log into their machine. As an administrator:  
1. First validate identity by asking the user for **full name** and **username**.  
2. Search for the user in ADUC to confirm account details.  
3. Reset password to a **temporary password**, with option ‚ÄúUser must change password at next logon.‚Äù  
4. Have the user log in and change password immediately.

### **Part 3 - Disabling and Deleting a User Account**

Policy simulated: When a user leaves the organization, their account should first be **disabled** and moved into a `Disabled Users` OU for 30 days before deletion.  

- Created an OU named `Disabled Users`.
